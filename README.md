# Talent-Poacher
Life Coach, Career Matchmaker, Networking Guru
I'm a Technical Recruiter and my strengths lie in my desire to help people plain & simple. I want to hear about YOU. Then we can talk about how I can help. 
I am always looking to network with individuals whether you are passively or aggressively swimming through the job market. Or, maybe you just want to talk.
I'm also currently binge watching The Office and How I Met Your Mother which takes up ALL of my time.
You can count me in when it comes to physical activities. Weight lifting, swimming and hiking are my bread and butter.
